# <div align="center"> Employee Management System </div>
A full-stack Employee Management System built using .NET Core (backend) and Angular (frontend).
It supports complete CRUD operations for managing employee records, including add, update, delete, and list.
The application features a responsive UI, RESTful APIs, and integration with a relational database like SQL Server.
# üìå Overview of What Is Being Built
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing employee records.
- Full-stack architecture using:
  - .NET Core Web API for the backend.
  - Angular for the frontend (SPA).
  - SQL Server as the database.
# Technology Stack
- Backend:
  - .NET 8
  - Entity Framework Core
  - SQL Server Database
- Frontend:
  - Angular 19
  - TypeScript
  - RxJS
# Design Decisions
1. **Standalone Components:**  We used Angular's standalone components to reduce the need for NgModules and simplify the application structure.
2. **Service-based Architecture:**  The EmployeeService acts as an intermediary between the components and the API, promoting separation of concerns.
3. **Reactive Programming:** We utilized RxJS Observables for handling asynchronous operations, making the code more maintainable and easier to reason about.
4. **Routing:** Angular Router was implemented to create a single-page application experience, allowing for seamless navigation between views.
5. **REST API:** The backend follows RESTful principles, providing a clear and consistent interface for CRUD operations.
# Challenges Faced
1. **HttpClient Injection:** Initially, we faced issues with injecting the HttpClient into our services and components. This was resolved by properly providing the HttpClientModule in the AppComponent and using provideHttpClient() in the main.ts file.

2. **Standalone Components Setup:** Transitioning to standalone components required careful management of imports and providers, which was a learning curve but ultimately led to a more streamlined application structure.

3. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Ensuring proper CORS configuration on the backend to allow requests from the Angular frontend.
